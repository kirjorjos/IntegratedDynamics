Fixes:
* Fix crash with complex Integrated Scripting functions in writers

Functions returning an any type could be inserted into writers such as
Integrated Tunnels exporters, and type checking would incorrectly pass.
This could result in crashes where an incorrect value cast would occur.
This commit makes it so that ANY types will have an additional type
check based on the actual determined value.

Closes CyclopsMC/IntegratedScripting#20
